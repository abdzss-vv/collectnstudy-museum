## Project rules
- Sample/demo data lives in `src/data/` (types in `types.ts`), never inline in route components — keeps content easy to replace.
- Reusable game UI lives in `src/components/game/`; colours only via tokens in `src/styles.css` — keeps theming in one place.
- Tests list persists in localStorage via `src/lib/tests-store.ts` (no backend in prototype) — scope excludes backend.
- MuseumHome is the shared immersive experience for home and museum; standalone collection and tests routes reuse their panel content — prevents competing screen implementations while preserving public URLs.
- FocusMode and StudySelector share pure timestamp-based session logic in study-session — keeps countdown accurate after inactive tabs and makes pause/completion testable.
- RewardsProvider owns pending and collected local rewards; pure rewards-store transitions deduplicate by session ID, and the global reveal survives navigation — keeps natural completion, confirmation and refresh recovery consistent across study entry points.
- Artwork reveal uses supplied PNG faces and one continuous CSS Y-axis rotation for opening and clicking — preserves physical two-sided rendering without resetting the angle after the reveal.
- MuseumScene renders user artwork as a proportional image in the home layout with container-relative exhibit hit areas; MuseumHome retains all panel/session state and custom artwork controls — keeps visual composition independent of viewport positioning and existing behavior.
